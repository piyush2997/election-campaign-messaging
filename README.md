## 🎯 Project Overview

This system provides a scalable backend infrastructure for managing election campaign communications, including:

- Campaign message management
- Voter outreach coordination
- Message scheduling and delivery
- Analytics and reporting

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Backend Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Development**: Hot-reload with ts-node-dev
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with CORS support
- **Environment**: Configurable via .env files

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/piyush2997/election-campaign-messaging.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd election-campaign-messaging

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server with hot-reload
npm run dev

# The server will start on http://localhost:5000 (or PORT from .env)
```
